\begin{cvparagraph}

Accomplished engineer \& scientist with a proven track record of delivering scalable, production-grade solutions that drive measurable business impact while managing relationships with a broad range of global stakeholders up to executive leadership.

At Amazon, I spearhead end-to-end projects across global teams, transforming complex technical challenges into innovative, data-driven programs that have realised a combined \$100M+ USD annual revenue gains. My expertise in ML, MLOps, and robust software engineering practices, combined with strategic stakeholder engagement enables me to successfully lead initiatives from ideation to global deployment.

Previously, I led the Adversarial AI team at \emph{Ascent Robotics} with the goal of validating fully autonomous vehicles, where we were successful in obtaining the first Level 3 self-driving certification in Japan. I also completed a research internship at the internationally-renowned \emph{AIST AI Research Center} \& AI energy company \textit{Informetis} in Tokyo, been awarded the prestigious \emph{Daiwa Scholarship}, and earned Master's degrees with highest merit from three top 10 global universities, \textit{Imperial College London}, \textit{UCL} \& \textit{NUS}. 

Inspired by my experiences and proven track record, I am committed to using machine learning as a catalyst for societal transformation, striving to make a genuine, lasting difference in people's lives.
