\begin{cvparagraph}

Accomplished engineer \& scientist with a proven track record of delivering scalable, production-grade solutions that drive measurable business impact while managing relationships with a broad range of global stakeholders up to executive leadership.

At Amazon, I spearhead end-to-end projects across global teams, transforming complex technical challenges into innovative, data driven products that unlock multi-million-dollar revenue gains and operational efficiencies. My expertise in ML, MLOps, and robust CI/CD practices, combined with strategic stakeholder engagement enables me to lead initiatives from ideation to global expansion. 

Prior to Amazon, I led the Adversarial AI team at \emph{Ascent Robotics} with the goal of validating fully autonomous vehicles for Japanese roads. I also completed a research internship at the internationally-renowned \emph{AIST AI Research Center} \& AI energy company \emph{Informetis} in Tokyo, been awarded the prestigious \emph{Daiwa Scholarship}, and earned Master's degrees with highest merit from three top 10 global universities. 

Inspired by my experiences and proven track record, I am committed to using machine learning as a catalyst for societal transformation, striving to make a genuine, lasting difference in people's lives.
